# How much fuel does the steam train need?

In the [puzzle video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqQvS2MSlps), we are presented with an aluminum-can-Steam-Train capable of holding ___500 miles worth of fuel___, needing to travel a distance of ___800 miles to party town___.

The train can accomplish this seemingly-impossible feat by leaving fuel at intermediate points along the track, returning back to the depot to refuel, and picking up the intermediate fuel to make it all the way to party town.

## Methods

To minimize the total amount of fuel used, we need to balance the number of "returns to depot" while still layout out adequate fuel to make it to the destination.
