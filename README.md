A collection of my "working out" for [Matt Parker's Math Puzzles](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzV9N7eGedBchEQjQhPapyQ/videos), a maths puzzle challenge series on YouTube by Matt Parker.

\*SIC: "maths" and "working out" are not true to my native tongue of U.S. English, but are used in homage to the vernacular of the puzzle creator.
